    <p class="textSpacing"> Reduce Plastic Use and Pollution: One of the most impactful actions individuals can take to support ocean conservation in New Zealand is to reduce plastic consumption and minimize plastic waste. This includes using reusable bags, bottles, and containers, avoiding single-use plastics, and participating in beach clean-up initiatives. By reducing plastic pollution, we can help prevent marine debris from harming marine life and ecosystems, as well as mitigate the impacts of plastic on ocean health and biodiversity.
